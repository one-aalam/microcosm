## Introduction
A very minimal micro-service monorepo

The project has 2 packages (inside packages directory)

- micro-one (http server)
- micro-two (http server)

## Techstack

- [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) - A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages
- [Micro](https://github.com/vercel/micro) - Asynchronous HTTP microservices

## Install
Checkout the repo and run
```sh
lerna bootstrap
```
in the project's directory

That's it ðŸš€.

_You'll find the dependenices installed and resolved now_

> `lerna` needs to be available globally for this

## Usage

Go to the root of the  project and run
```
lerna start
```

That's it ðŸš€.

_You'll find the services available on their respective ports. Visit the respective ports and see `em in action._

## Lerna Quick-Reference
Since most of the `micros` will share some common characterstics and behavior, Lerna is levaraged to manage community and cross-micro
depenedencies so that it's DRY and less boring DX for ya!

Here are few of the commands you may find yourselves looking up quite often
```sh
# Adds the module-1 package to the packages in the 'prefix-' prefixed folders
lerna add module-1 packages/prefix-*

# Install module-1 to module-2
lerna add module-1 --scope=module-2

# Install module-1 to module-2 in devDependencies
lerna add module-1 --scope=module-2 --dev

# Install module-1 to module-2 in peerDependencies
lerna add module-1 --scope=module-2 --peer

# Install module-1 in all modules except module-1
lerna add module-1

# Install babel-core in all modules
lerna add babel-core
```
